# CNN-Digit-Recognizer
In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to perform image recognition, image classifications. Object detections, facial recognition etc.


The goal of this project is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
